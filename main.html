<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems and building things that make life easier for people. 
        Technology has the power to create meaningful change, and I want to be part of that transformation. 
        I am inspired by how coding combines creativity and logic, allowing me to continuously learn and improve while
		contributing to real-world projects.</p>
